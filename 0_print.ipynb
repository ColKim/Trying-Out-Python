    "Now let's look at the anatomy of a function. First, the name of the function we called is \"print\". The print functions takes in 1 argument, which in this case is what we want to be printed to the console, \"Goodbye World\". Arguments for any and all functions are passed by encasing them in parenthesis. In python, we don't always have to pass in an argument to the print function. We could just called print and it would pass with no error:"
